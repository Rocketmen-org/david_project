To run, simply type "make", and then "./my_game".

To walk around, press either the left or right arrow keys to move left or right respectively.
	You can hold down a key to keep moving in that direction.

To jump, press the up arrow key.
	Once you commit to a jump, you can't change direction. Don't try, you'll hurt yourself.
		Just like real life.
		
To quit just click the 'x' at the top corner of the screen.
